									<h2>Education</h2>
									<br />
									<h3>Monash University</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/monashsquare.svg" alt="" /></span><strong>Monash University UX/UI Boot Camp:</strong> Whilst working full time, six days a week at Revolution Racegear using the skills I developed with RMIT I discovered that problem solving and design are skills that I’m not just passionate about but am also driven to achieve greater things with. Upon starting this course, despite the fast pace it was immediately apparent that <strong>User Experience, User Interface design and Coding</strong> is something I have an affinity for and is closely aligned with my prior education and career experience which has revolved around customer focused solutions and problem solving. I am seeking an opportunity to put these skills to use in the industry to design user focused solutions which help to bridge the gap from users to businesses.</p>
									<br /> 
									<h3>RMIT</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/rmitsquare.svg" alt="" /></span><strong>Implementing Digital Marketing Campaigns:</strong> Facebook and Google continue to dominate the landscape with the ACCC estimating that 71 cents of every dollar spent on digital advertising in Australia goes to Google or Facebook. I completed this course in order to upskill my social media awareness and improve my ability to connect with people via digital mediums through targeted content and engaging visuals with demonstrable results.</p>
                                    <br /> 
									<h3>Monash University</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/monashsquare.svg" alt="" /></span><b>Bachelor of Arts:</b> My tertiary education started at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia with a Bachelor of Arts degree completed with a double major in Philosophy and Sociology. Within this degree I covered a wide range of minor units including Psychology but found a particular interest in learning about complex concepts, ethics and the understanding of people. The sociological component focused on understanding groups of people, what drives them and motivates them to take action. I’ve found this background useful in the completion of case studies and the identification of problems during the user research phase providing valuable insights into the approaches taken to design a solution.</p>
									<br /> 
									<h2>Experience</h2>
									<br />
									<h3>Penrite Oil</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/penritesquare.svg" alt="" /></span>After finding success in relationship building, digital marketing, product photography, design and social media campaigns through Revolution Racegear I attracted the attention of Penrite Oil, one of Australia’s most successful and longest running family owned businesses. Since 1926 Penrite Oil have developed and locally produced the highest quality motor oil products for consumer and competition use and I have now taken up the position of Digital Marketing Officer. </p>
									<br /> 
									<h3>Revolution Racegear</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/revosquare.svg" alt="" /></span>After making the decision to leave the finance industry I sought to move into an industry I am passionate about with the capacity to build my underlying yet unharnessed design talents via self-driven learning. Working in a Sales and Marketing position for three years I had the pleasure of meeting and working with some of the industry’s <b>greatest</b> talents and on a daily basis I had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of customers to understand not just what they wanted but what they may also <i>need</i> to achieve their personal goals in motorsport and ensure their safety. Over this time I managed the national social media platforms and worked hard to develop contemporary, engaging and professional standard content which included end-to-end planning, product photography, designing digital assets, refining a style guide, social media strategy, briefing franchises and distributing assets for consistent use online and executing digital campaigns for new products. </p>
									<br />
									<h3>ANZ</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/anzsquare.svg" alt="" /></span>After completing my degree I took on an entry level bank teller position and worked my way up through the organisation with skills in relationship building, spotting opportunities for referrals and an ability to develop a genuine rapport with customers of diverse backgrounds quickly and effectively. I progressed to Personal Banker at the busiest branch in Melbourne and quickly from there to Mortgage Specialist, Client Manager and finally ANZ Mobile Lender in both customer facing and remote capacities.</p>

									<h2>Summary</h2>
									<div class="box">
										<p><b>Why is this important?</b> <br />
											My tertiary education has equipped me with the skills to think about the <i>bigger picture</i> and understand people at an individual and group level in addition to learning the skills required to plan studies, coordinate interviews, collate data and present the findings in written and verbal settings. This foundation has led me to upskill in specific areas including digital marketing with a focus on contemporary customer interaction trends in addition to comprehensive work in the disciplines of User Experience, User Interface and Coding. The sum of this education combined with my experience in a complex and <b>high pressure</b> retail sales environment has given me a unique insight into people through study and hands on experience with customers and users in a face to face setting, over the phone and via digital communication. The combination of the <i>soft skills</i> of sales and rapport building skills combined with the <i>technical skills</i> of user research, iteration, wireframing, high fidelity design and coding have proven to be a successful combination in my experience with UX/UI design and I believe I have a lot to offer in this capacity.</p>
